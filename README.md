## My recreation of Google Keep

Using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

I used MongoDB to store the notes so they persist.
The backend is running on an express server that implements GET, POST, and DELETE requests that interact with the MongoDB database.
The frontend is React.
I also added functionality to not allow the user to add empty notes.
